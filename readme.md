Simply choose a template, fill in as much (or as little) info as you want, and then press <kbd>Make</kbd> to see your output. You can change your template at any point to see how your resume looks with different designs.

When you're happy with your result, you can download the resume as a PDF, TeX, or JSON document. The JSON output is compatible with [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org).

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome, and I am always happy to help out first-timers contributors with any questions you may have. You can check out the [contributing.md](./contributing.md) for an in-depth guide on how to get started on working on the app.
